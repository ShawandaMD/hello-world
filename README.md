# hello-world
A whole new woooooorld

Hey ya'll,

My name is Shawanda and I'm super excited about this coding journey! I havent felt this excited about learning in a while.
I'm originally from Miami, Florida but I live in New York City now. I miss the sun and beaches but food is close and available at all times of the day... so there you have it.
